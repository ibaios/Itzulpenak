<entry name="To sleep eternal, what difference from death?"></entry>
<entry name="LURIEN_CONVO_3">My city. Do you sustain without me? Do you thrive? I would see your streets again...</entry>
<entry name="That plague, it calls to something within. But that union it offers is a lie, the cost, a mind regressed."></entry>
<entry name="For diversity. For variance. For evolution. I become bond upon the Vessel."></entry>
<entry name="My mind is seal upon that tragic being. But who shall teach them now? Who shall open their minds, where I cannot?"></entry>
<entry name="This little shadow...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Must return to its darkness."></entry>

<entry name="Our King appears as bug, and I shall take him as so.But his are traits that transcend our kind. His is a mind beyond ours. Deity given form.In sleep, I shall not look upon his like again."></entry>
<entry name="We sealed that plague, and thought we&#39;d found an answer, but we were wrong.&lt;page&gt;Our sacrifices... what did they win us? A world sealed in stasis."></entry>
<entry name="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open your minds, brother and sister.&lt;br&gt;Our vow was to protect...but do we? The Vessel weakens."></entry>

<entry name="MONOMON_CONVO_2">Our sacred Hallownest... It was so old. An eternal, undying kingdom... unchanging.&lt;page&gt;They called me &#39;Teacher&#39;, but what did I have left to teach? What did I have left to learn?</entry>
<entry name="MONOMON_CONVO_3">When the light came, we feared it. Of course we did! So we fought to keep things as they were.&lt;page&gt;Our sacrifices... what did they win us? Simply another kind of stasis. </entry>
<entry name="MONOMON_CONVO_4">We fought against you, too. Struggling against our fate.&lt;page&gt;The light we caged away... it is alive, and we are not. Is that what draws you to it?</entry>
