<entry name="hour">No specific time is ever perceptible. Enforces the idea of a world in stasis. &#39;An age ago&#39; is okay. </entry>
<entry name="Wood to Shellwood">Doesn&#39;t come up much, but this is probably what Zote&#39;s Nail is made from. Also what the beams in the mines are made from.</entry>
<entry name="day, year"></entry>
<entry name="Magic">spell is used, but magic in Hollow Knight is generally a shamanistic thing, so the words around it are more &#39;will&#39; &#39;spirit&#39; &#39;force&#39; and emotions like &#39;rage&#39; &#39;vengeance&#39; &#39;longing&#39; etc. Maybe magic can be used?</entry>
<entry name="minute"></entry>
<entry name="Monarch"></entry>
<entry name="tree">no trees in hallownest, only roots, leaves and plants.</entry>
<entry name="seal, seals">do a check for the pluralisation here. There is one seal (around the hollow knight, that includes the binding spells, the chains, the dreamers and the egg). Each of the dreamers is part of that seal, not &#39;A&#39; seal. &lt;&lt;&lt;this is no longer accurate. I ended up pluralising seals. It became too difficult otherwise -Ari.</entry>
<entry name="British to American english">Hollow Knight uses British English. Run a spell check. Channelled, not Channeled.</entry>
<entry name="dressed">check for it. can be used in special instances, but not a common word/</entry>
<entry name="lady, man">is lady okay? Check its usage. As a royal thing maybe? Or maybe better to avoid it completely.</entry>
<entry name="rather">just check this hasn&#39;t been used too much by Ari (I use this a lot!)</entry>
<entry name="Knight">Are knights a special term in the kingdom? so only the hollow knight and the five king&#39;s knights are referred to as &#39;Knight&#39;. All others eg mage knights, royal guards should no tbe referred to as &#39;knights&#39;</entry>
<entry name="Knight or knight?">is it always capitalised. Should it be? Currently inconsistent in the text.</entry>
<entry name="today">no days. its one long night</entry>
<entry name="SOUL and soul">in UI text it should be SOUL in full caps, as seen on the first Tut tab. Currently inconsistent.</entry>
<entry name="Hands">Few creatures have hands. Avoid it if possible.</entry>
<entry name="Species not race">do a find and manual replace for each of these.</entry>
<entry name="Fingers"></entry>
<entry name="money? ">probably should be just geo. but could say the kingdom&#39;s currency.</entry>
<entry name="God">perhaps in special instance? though usually the god-like creatures are higher beings.</entry>
<entry name="night"></entry>
<entry name="Clothes">Cloak is okay. Otherwise the bugs wear no clothes.</entry>
<entry name="skin is shell">Most things don&#39;t have skin. the bugs refer to their exteriors as shell.</entry>
<entry name="Sword"></entry>
<entry name="Blade">Can be used if directly connected to a weapon ie a nail&#39;s blade.</entry>
<entry name="gender notes">the hollow knights have no gender. Check for hims and hes. Is the Wyrm King gendered? probably. or is it that when the wyrm took king form it gained a gender?Hornet is the Gendered Child. She can be referred to as female.</entry>
<entry name="Crown">can be a crown as in the top of a head, but not a separate object.</entry>
<entry name="eyes">can be used, but check carefully, many of the bugs may not have eyes, rather just sockety things.</entry>
<entry name="human"></entry>
<entry name="Journal Pluralisation">THis should be consistent. Most follow this formula, but not all: standard note is singluar.Hunter&#39;s note speaks to the species normally, but can be either, because it&#39;s more casual.</entry>
<entry name="Feet">these may not exist at all?</entry>
<entry name="person, people"></entry>
<entry name="Day, today">remove anything this specific about time.</entry>
<entry name="hot spa hot spring">probably go with spring over spa. Is spa a man made thing? spas are man-made, but the spas in this game do seem as though they&#39;ve been constructed. wither term is fine though</entry>
<entry name="Geo">is Geo capitalised? Should it be?</entry>
<entry name="- hyphens">Can be used for conjoined words, but should be avoided in sentences, given the classic style of the text. use commas and full-stops instead.</entry>
<entry name="but, though">check Ari hasn&#39;t used these too much as well and replace where possible/necessary.</entry>
<entry name="book">not sure if these exist? Likely not. Journals exist. Tablets exist. Parchment exists. Journals look like they&#39;re made of stone. the relic dealer references parchment made from spider silk, but its not common.</entry>
<entry name="Bretta White Saviour">To obscure the knight&#39;s gender in this instance, White Prince should probably be replaced with White Saviour.</entry>
